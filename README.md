# Python Programs: Factorial Calculator & Math Module Operations

This repository contains two simple Python scripts that demonstrate the use of functions and Python's built-in `math` module for basic mathematical operations.

## ðŸ“„ Files Included

1. **Task_1_Factorial_Function.py**  
   A Python program that:
   - Defines a function named `factorial` that calculates the factorial of a given number using a loop.
   - Returns the calculated factorial.
   - Calls the function with a sample number and displays the result.

2. **Task_2_Using_Math_Module.py**  
   A Python program that:
   - Takes a number as input from the user.
   - Uses the `math` module to calculate:
     - The square root of the number.
     - The natural logarithm (log base e) of the number.
     - The sine of the number (in radians).
   - Displays the calculated results.

## âœ… How to Run the Programs

Make sure you have Python installed on your machine (version 3.x recommended).

Then, run the scripts using the command line or any Python IDE:

```bash
python Task_1_Factorial_Function.py
python Task_2_Using_Math_Module.py
